# Federal Budget Sankey

WIP!

[Live Demo](https://masonchinkin.github.io/budgetSankey/)

Coming from an economics background, I always felt sankeys were underutilized as a tool to communicate fiscal policy. Maybe now I know why, because this was not trivial!

I made this just before I began my journey to be a full stack engineer and I am in the process of improving the code quality and refactoring this into a proper Webpacked project.

## Features

* Dashboard gives the user 3 different slices of fiscal data since 1968: 1) a bar chart showing the overall balance every year, 2) a sankey showing the flows for a given year, and 3) line charts showing the history for each fiscal category.
* Sankey transitions to any year selected through the slider.
* Hovering the mouse over fiscal categories highlights it in the sankey and line charts.
